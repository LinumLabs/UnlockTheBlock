Thanks to this [Ethereum API helpers](https://github.com/oraclize/ethereum-api) using Oraclize in your Solidity/Serpent code is very easy.

In Solidity it is as simple as inheriting the `usingOraclize` contract: this will provide you some functions, like `oraclize_query`, which make it trivial to leverage our technology straight away.

If you are using Serpent just import `oraclizeAPI.se` and enjoy the same Oraclize helper functions via macros!
