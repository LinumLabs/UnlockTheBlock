SocketCluster integration tests
===============================

The 'external' directory validates the behavioral aspect of SocketCluster (as it would appear to a client/user).
The 'internal' directory verifies that SocketCluster manages its internal resources appropriately.
Launch a test by running the appropriate index.js file using the 'node' command.
