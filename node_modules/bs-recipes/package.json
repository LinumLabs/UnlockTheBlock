Couldn't get one of the examples running? Have your own sweet setup that you want to show off to the world?\nWe'd love to receive your feedback and contributions - so please get in touch! We aim to make this project the canonical source \nof example projects & code snippets related to running Browsersync.\n\n### How to contribute an example\n\nFirst thing you should do, is take a look at our [simplest example here](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/server) - \nthis will give you a great head-start on setting up your code.\n\nThen, `fork` this repo and `clone` your fork down to your local machine. Now create a new folder inside `recipes`\n(note the naming structure). This is where you create your awesome example. You're free to do as you like,\nbut there are a couple of rules you'll need to follow to ensure the project can build.\n\n**Required Files**\n\n- `package.json` (see below for requirements)\n- `app.js` (or any JS file showing the example)\n- `./app` directory. Always include the minimum HTML, JS & CSS needed to prove your example.\n\n**Do NOT include**\n- `readme.md` (this is created dynamically for you)\n- any other files that are not related to your example.\n\n\n### package.json requirements\n\n\n**start command**: For consistency, ensure your example can be run with the command `npm start`. To \ndo this, you just need to provide something along these lines:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node app.js\"\n},\n```\n\n**main file**: We inline your main Javascript file into the `readme.md`, so\ndon't miss this field.\n\n```json\n\"main\": \"app.js\" // or gulpfile.js etc\n```\n\n**description**: We use this as the Title. So make it short and descriptive, such as \n\n```json\n\"description\": \"Server example\"\n```\n\n### Finally, build.\nAfter you've added your example in the recipes folder, return to the root and run\n\n```bash\nnpm install && npm run build\n```\n\nThis will install [Crossbow.js](https://github.com/shakyShane/crossbow.js) and compile the project.\nCommit everything that has changed and push it up to your fork. Send a Pull Request when you're\nready, or if you'd like us to have a look over your code before that, just ping us [twitter](https://twitter.com/browsersync) and we'll \ntake a look! ",
