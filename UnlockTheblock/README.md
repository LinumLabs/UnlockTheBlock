# UnlockTheBlock

This repo is inteded to handle the submissions for the upcoming Unlock the Block hacakthon, hosted in collaboration with Linum Labs and the University of Cape Town. 

Because we want to teach and encourage the same open source principles that underpin blockchains and decentralized networks more generally, we have decided to adopt an approach where each team will open an issue for their submission, and then submit a Pull Request that fixes their issue with the code they have written.

This achieves two primary aims. First, it ensures that all work done during the hackathon remains open source, like all the best code there is. Secondly, it introduces students and other developers to GitHub and the open source community more generally and equips them with the skills to use resources like this for all future projects, whether they be specifically within the blockchain space, or outside it in the wider programming, FOSS community. 

This is not to say that students and other developers cannot take what they build in the hackathon, extend it and sell it onwards in a more proprietary fashion - all IP remains with the people who write the actual code. It's just our gentle way of encouraging people just entering the industry to adopt the best practices around how they work on and share their software.

For a great, if long, introduction and historical overview of why this sort of thing is of vital importance, not only to blockchain but also software development more generally, please see this fantastic documentary:
